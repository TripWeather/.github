## Overview

Have you ever planned a road trip and were suddenly faced with having to plan around inclement weather such as a Blizzard or a Hurricane? Or even the pop-up afternoon thunderstorm with a chance of tornados? With <b>Trip Weather</b> we can help you coordinate your trips with weather status for the beginning and end of your trip. You can include stops along the trip that the application can include the weather status for as well. 

## How / Under the hood

We have consumed the the [fill_in_here] API and [fill_in_here] API we take the starting location, the destination, and any added stops to the trip and pull the weather data for each location based on when you are expected to arive at that location. [Future + with exporting and/or sharing trip]
