# Trip Weather

## Overview

Have you ever planned a road trip and were suddenly faced with having to plan around inclement weather such as a Blizzard or a Hurricane? Or even the pop-up afternoon thunderstorm with a chance of tornadoes? With <b>Trip Weather</b> we can help you coordinate your trips with weather status for the beginning and end of your trip. You can include stops along the trip that the application can include the weather status for as well. 

## How / Under the hood

We have consumed the the [MapQuest API](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/) for navigation instructions of the trip and to convert addresses to Lat/Long to then plug into the [Weather.gov API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api#/) for local weather data. We take the starting location, the destination and pull the weather data for each location along with providing trip details such as turn by turn instructions, travel distance, total travel time (using current traffic patterns), and 

## If we had unlimited time:

We added functionality to return the given weather data at the time you will be at a given location but ran out of time to implement it. Also added the data pull on the LAT/LONG of each turn during the trip to then pull the weather for to give a comprehensive forecast of the entire trip. We would like to add a friend functionality to be able to add others to your planned trips to share itenerary information. With that we would also add the ability to add the trip to your google calendars and/or export your trip to save for offline use.
